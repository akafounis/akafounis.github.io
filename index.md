## Welcome to my Portfolio !

**Hi!** \
My name is [**Angelos Kafounis**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angeloskafounis/) and in this website you can find awesome projects that I have been working on!


### Semantic Segmentation

I developed a deep learning model to be able to classify each pixel of an image to 23 different object classes. More information about the results and the architecture that was used for the model you can find [here](https://akafounis.github.io/dl-ss/).


### Facial Keypoints Detection

I created a deep learning model to be able to detect the main keypoints of a human face. Detecting the keypoints on the human face is the key to a lot of computer vision applications, such as Facial Recognition. More information about the results and the architecture that was used for the model you can find [here](https://akafounis.github.io/facial-keypoint).


### Bundle Adjustment

The projects goal is to show a sample application of Bundle Adjustment in reconstructing 3D scenes, and it involves three major steps of key features finding and matching, geometric estimation, and recovering the 3D structure of the scene using bundle adjustment.

For more details see [Bundle Adjustment](https://akafounis.github.io/bundle-adjustment/).


### Algorithmic Trading Bot

This project is about constructing an automated bot which in real-time takes information about the current state of the stock market, analyzes them using some certain techniques and based on the result of the analysis, it buys or sells its current stocks. 

For more details see [Trading Bot Source Code](https://akafounis.github.io/Algo-Trading-Bot/).

### 3D Back Projection

The goal of this project is to generate 3D meshes from depth and color maps which can be captured by depth cameras, like Microsoft Kinect.
