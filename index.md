## Welcome to my Project Page !

Hi! My name is Angelos Kafounis and in this website you can find awsome projects that I have been working on!

### Projects

### Semantic Segmentation

<img src="SS.jpg" width="400">
Built a deep learning model to be able to classify each pixel of an image to 23 different object classes. More information about the results and the architecture that was used for the model you can find [here](https://akafounis.github.io/dl-ss/).


This project is about constructing an automated bot which in real-time takes information about the current state of the stock market, analyzes them using some certain techniques and based on the result of the analysis, it buys or sells its current stocks.

The goal of this project is to generate 3D meshes from depth and color maps which can be captured by depth cameras, like Microsoft Kinect.
