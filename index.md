This project is about constructing an automated bot which in real-time takes information about the current state of the stock market, analyzes them using some certain techniques and based on the result of the analysis, it buys or sells its current stocks. 

For more details see [Trading Bot Source Code](https://akafounis.github.io/Algo-Trading-Bot/).
