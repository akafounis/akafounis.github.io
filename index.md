### Projects

Here you are going to find a list of all the projects that I have been working on in the past years.

### 1. Algorithmic Trading Bot
This project is about constructing an automated bot which in real-time takes information about the current state of the stock market, analyzes them using some certain techniques and based on the result of the analysis, it buys or sells its current stocks.
